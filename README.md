I am a working student, currently attending University of Bucharest and working for a cybersecurity start-up from Germany. I enjoy low-level porgramming using C, scripting and sniffing in Python, any kind of systems-level programming and computing in general. Some of my notable achievements are building a custom RISC-V assembler + executor with a group of friends, implementing some basic machine learning algorithms for convolutional networks in Python, and some other small projects you can check out on my profile.
