I am a comp-sci student, currently attending University of Bucharest. I enjoy low-level porgramming using C, scripting and machine learning in Python, and computing in general. Some of my notable achievements are building a custom RISC-V assembler + executor with a group of friends, implementing some basic machine learning algorithms for convolutional networks in Python, and some other small projects you can check out on my profile.
